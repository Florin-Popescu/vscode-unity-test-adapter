# C Unity Test Explorer

Run your [Unity](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity) tests using the
[Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer) extension.

![Screenshot](img/screenshot.png)

## Features

* Shows a Test Explorer in the Test view in VS Code's sidebar with all detected tests and suites and their state
* Adds CodeLenses to your test files for starting and debugging tests
* Adds Gutter decorations to your test files showing the tests' state
* Adds line decorations to the source line where a test failed
* Shows a failed test's log when the test is selected in the explorer
* Lets you choose test suites that should be run automatically after each file change

## Getting started

* Install the extension and restart VS Code
* Open the workspace or folder containing your Unity framework project
* [Configure](#options) the extension based on your project's needs. Minimum required configurations:
    * `unityExplorer.testSourceFileRegex` - regex used to find test source files. It must distinguish between the unit test sources and the production sources.
	* `unityExplorer.testCaseRegex` - regex used to find test cases in a test source file. The name of the test must be put in a matching group (inside parenthesis).
	* `unityExplorer.testExecutableArgs` - if using Unity Fixtures (instead of the regular Unity test macros) this must be set to `-v`. This is because the extension expects even passed tests to have some output to distinguish from tests which weren't run at all, and this is only provided with `-v`.
* Open the Test view
* Run your tests using the ![Run](img/run.png) icons in the Test Explorer or the CodeLenses in your test file

## Configuration

### Options

Example folder structure:
`.` - the root of the workspace
`./makefile` - the makefile which describes how to build the unit tests
`folders` - a target in the makefile which creates needed folder structure (i.e. creates `./out`)
`./src` - the folder where all tested sources are to be found
`./src/foo.c` - a testable source file
`bar()` - a function in `foo.c` which should be unit tested
`./testsrc` - the folder where the unit test sources are to be found
`./testsrc/fooTest.c `- a unit test for `foo.c`
`test_bar1()` and `test_bar2()` - actual unit tests: functions in `fooTest.c` which test `bar()` in `foo.c`
`./out/test` - the path to the built unit tests
`./out/test/fooTest.exe` - the executable which would be built by the extension to run the tests in `fooTest.c`
`-v` - the argument which must be passed to `fooTest.exe` to also show passed tests
`-n test_bar1` - an optional argument which can be passed to `fooTest.exe` to speed up its execution by only running a single test case `test_bar1()`

Property                                | Description                                                   | Example
----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------
`unityExplorer.debugConfiguration`      | Configuration to run when debugging tests. See [Debugging](#debugging) for more info. | `Unit Test`
`unityExplorer.prettyTestCaseRegex`     | Regular expression to be used to simplify the test case label which by default is the full function name. Put what you want to keep in the first matching group and the rest will be removed. Leave empty to disable this. <br> Inactive: <br> ![prettyTestFileLabelInactive](img/prettyTestFileLabelInactive.png) <br> Active: <br> ![prettyTestFileLabelActive](img/prettyTestFileLabelActive.png) | `test_(\w+)`
`unityExplorer.prettyTestFileRegex`     | Regular expression to be used to simplify the test file label which by default contains the relative path to the file as well as its extension. Put what you want to keep in the first matching group and the rest will be removed. Leave empty to disable this. <br> Inactive: <br> ![prettyTestLabelInactive](img/prettyTestLabelInactive.png) <br> Active: <br> ![prettyTestLabelActive](img/prettyTestLabelActive.png) | `(\w+)Test.c`
`unityExplorer.unitUnderTestFolder`     | The path the extension should use to look for the unit under test source files. By default the workspace root is used. | `src`
`unityExplorer.unitUnderTestFileRegex`  | Regular expression against which unit under test source files should match. These are tracked for changes to mark test results as old if not re-run. | `\w+\.[ch]`
`unityExplorer.testSourceFolder`        | The path the extension should use to look for the unit test source files. By default the workspace root is used. | `testsrc`
`unityExplorer.testSourceFileRegex`     | Regular expression against which test source files should match.                         | `\w+Test.c`
`unityExplorer.testCaseRegex`           | Regular expression against which test cases in a file should match. The actual test case name must be put in the first matching group, while the rest of the regular expression can be used to match only the lines containing test names. | `void\s+(test_.*)\s*\(.*\)`
`unityExplorer.preBuildCommand`         | Any command which must be run before building the unit tests. If empty, no command will be run. | `make clean`
`unityExplorer.testBuildApplication`    | Application used to build the tests (e.g. `make`, `cmake`, `gcc`). A test will be built by running this with the `testBuildTargetRegex` as build target. | `make`
`unityExplorer.testBuildCwdPath`        | The current working directory where the build command will be run in. By default the workspace root is used. | `.`
`unityExplorer.testBuildArgs`           | Any additional arguments that need to be passed to the build command when building a test. Note that the target to be built is passed separately, so there is no need to add it here. | `-DTEST`
`unityExplorer.testBuildTargetRegex`    | Regular expression which should be applied to the test source file name (without extension) to produce a target for the build system. A `$1` will be replaced with the file name. By default just the source file name without extension will be used (e.g. for `test/unitTest.c`, `make unitTest` will be called). | `out/test/$1.exe`
`unityExplorer.testExecutableLauncher`  | Launcher command used to start the test executable file | `run_test.sh`
`unityExplorer.testExecutableRegex`     | Regular expression which should be applied to the test source file name (without extension) to produce the executable file name to run the test. A `$1` will be replaced with the file name. By default just the source file name without extension will be used (e.g. for `test/unitTest.c`, `unitTest` will be ran). | `out/test/$1.exe`
`unityExplorer.testExecutableArgs`      | Any additional arguments that need to be passed to the test executable when running it. | `-v`
`unityExplorer.testExecutableArgSingleCaseRegex` | Regular expression which should be applied to a test case (not the pretty-fied label) and passed as argument to the test executable to only run that test case. This speeds up execution when a single test case of a large file is needed to be run. A `$1` will be replaced with the test case name. By default all the file's test cases are run even if a single test case is run from the interface. | `-n $1`

## Commands

The following commands are available in VS Code's command palette, use the ID to add them to your keyboard shortcuts:

ID                                 | Command
-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------
`test-explorer.reload`             | Reload tests
`test-explorer.run-all`            | Run all tests
`test-explorer.run-file`           | Run tests in current file
`test-explorer.run-test-at-cursor` | Run the test at the current cursor position
`test-explorer.cancel`             | Cancel running tests

## Debugging

To set up debugging, create a new Debug Configuration.
`${command:unityExplorer.debugTestExecutable}` can be used access the test executable filename being ran, with the relative path to it configured by `unityExplorer.testBuildPath`.
`${command:unityExplorer.debugTestExecutableArgs}` can be used as the executable arguments for the program to debug, constructed according to `unityExplorer.testExecutableArgs` and `unityExplorer.testExecutableArgSingleCaseRegex`
Then, edit the `unityExplorer.debugConfiguration` settings with the name of the Debug Configuration to run during debug.

Example configuration for `gdb`:
```json
{
    "name": "Unity Test Explorer Debug",
    "type": "cppdbg",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/${command:unityExplorer.debugTestExecutable}",
    "args": ["${command:unityExplorer.debugTestExecutableArgs}"],
    "stopAtEntry": false,
    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "environment": [],
    "externalConsole": false,
    "MIMode": "gdb",
    "miDebuggerPath": "C:/MinGW/bin/gdb.exe",
    "setupCommands": [
        {
            "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
            "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
            "ignoreFailures": true
        }
    ]
}
```
